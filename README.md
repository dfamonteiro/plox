# plox: A Python implementation of the jlox interpreter

Well, the title says it all, really. This is a implementation of the tree-walk interpreter found in Section II of Bob Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) book. You can execute programs by calling
```
python plox.py your_file_here.lox
```
Enjoy!
